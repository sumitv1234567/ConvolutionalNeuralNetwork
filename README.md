# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
In this project I made a simple conolutional neural network model which with train on some images of cats and dogs and then predict on a completely new image, whether its a cat or dog. As dataset was a collection of images of cats and dogs and it was large I am providing link to google drive where model with dataset is stored and I am uploading ipynb and python files here too.
